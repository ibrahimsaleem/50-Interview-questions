## üöÄ Remember

**Consistency is key!** Practice daily, even if just for 30 minutes. Understanding the patterns and techniques is more important than speed. Speed will come with practice.

**Focus on learning, not just solving.** Take time to understand why each solution works and when to use different approaches.

**Practice explaining your solutions.** Being able to communicate your thinking is as important as solving the problem.

**Don't get discouraged by difficult problems.** Every expert was once a beginner. Keep practicing and you will improve.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
